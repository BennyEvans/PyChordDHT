PyChordDHT
==========

Python Chord DHT implementation. Provides the network structure organization as per the Chord algorithm. If you don't know how the algorithm works, take a look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer). This implementation does not handle objects at nodes as not all applications needing a DHT require objects at nodes (some applications just need to find nodes).
